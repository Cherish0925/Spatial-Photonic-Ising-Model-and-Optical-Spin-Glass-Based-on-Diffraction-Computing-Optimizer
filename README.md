# Spatial-Photonic-Ising-Model-and-Optical-Spin-Glass-Based-on-Diffraction-Computing-Optimizer
Programming language is Python, based on torch and munpy. It precisely models the light field propagation between multiple planes, enabling the research of spatial light Ising machines and spin glasses. It assists the Markov Monte Carlo algorithm by optimizing the Hamiltonian of the QUBO problem through lens-based Fourier transformation.

# Project File Description
- "General_Optical_Ising_Optimizer.py" The file serves as the entry point for solving QUBO problems. By simply modifying the coupling interaction matrix J of the Ising problem within this file, it can be adapted to the problems you wish to optimize through spatial optical computing.
- "Bandlimited_ASM.py" is a file that uses PyTorch to calculate the light field propagation process between multiple planes, and it includes options for whether to use a lens or not.
- "decompose_J_coupling_matrix.py" The file is adapted for the spatial light Ising calculation system, which can only optimize the coupling interaction problem with a rank of 1 in a single step. Therefore, by leveraging the tensor calculation capabilities of the graphics card, the originally high-rank matrix is decomposed and then stacked into a three-channel dimensional tensor. 
- "datas_process.py" The file is for data visualization and processing.
